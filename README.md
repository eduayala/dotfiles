# ‚öôÔ∏è My Dotfiles & Configurations

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository! This is where I store and manage my configuration files for various applications, my OS, and other settings. The goal is to keep them organized, version-controlled, and easily deployable across different machines. Feel free to explore, borrow, or adapt any of these configurations for your own setup!
